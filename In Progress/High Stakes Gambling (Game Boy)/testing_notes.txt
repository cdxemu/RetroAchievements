TODO:
finish any TODOs in rascript code
measured/trigger conditions?
replace basic slots criteria from "2 lines" to "combined payout of at least 10x your bet"?
Leaderboards - each mission: winnings/remaining DPP, game end: total winnings, craps?
test for false triggers on loading password + password protection
change Practice cheevos (except Craps) to either mode?
consider making Challenges be vs. specific gangster (for variety)?
add GB Bios protection https://docs.retroachievements.org/Console-Specific-Tips/#gb-and-gbc-bios
should "Current Mission Winnings" be included in RP/achievements?

Alternative to "any gangster" challenges:
Max		use no cheats			(10)
Sam		cash out				(10)
Harry	use all cheats			(10)
Louie	300K winnings?			(10) alt: time, DP out, lose first three/win DP
Al		win all casino games	(25)
Take 2:
Max		use no cheats			(10)
Sam		300K winnings?			(10)
Harry	use all cheats			(10)
Louie	cash out				(10)
Al		win all casino games	(25)

Memory Digging TODO:
need way to reliably identify "hand/spin started/ended" that also works on the first & last hand/spin - also might need "poker 1st draw vs. 2nd draw"
find cheat used (player and oppponent)? - otherwise can watch for quantity decrease

Unused Titles:
