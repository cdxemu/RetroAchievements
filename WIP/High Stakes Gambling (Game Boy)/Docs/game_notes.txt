TODO:
Change "any gangster" challenges to be vs. specific gangster (variety pack)
Max		use no cheats			(10)	-done
Sam		use all cheats			(10)	-done
Harry	win DP in <= 6 hands 	(10)	-untested
Louis	350K winnings?			(10)	-untested/needs measured?
Al		win all casino games	(25)	-needs trigger? (difficult to add - would need to redo implementation)
*maybe: add win 500K winnings against any gangster, replace 350K winnings w/ win all BJ (exclude dealer BJ and allow push 21 - need to decide how to handle split), and swap M3 & M4 "Rosetti No Spaghetti"
Alt ideas: win all BJ (exclude dealer BJ) or DP hands, win X in a row BJ or DP hands, cash out in DP, cash out in BJ (very rare/luck-based), lose first three/win DP, time limit, win two jackpots

change Craps achievement from "win multiple (5?) bets at once": determine how many can be possibly won at once to set appropriate number (depending on rarity) - 5 for craps, 6 for 6/8?, 9 for 7?

Craps -  how to fix "too complex" achievements:
count # of bets made at end of players turn - must be equal to X
on AI turn, count/check winning bets

Craps - need to also check if bet is "Off"?

revise Poker achievements to use "Draw Number" where applicable

finish any TODOs in rascript code
redo scoring badges
combine the practice slots/VP achievements (two each) into one each?
more measured/trigger conditions?
Leaderboards - each mission remaining DPP?, most cash in each casino game?, craps?

Done:
change Video Poker scoring events to both modes?
test for false triggers on loading password + password protection
test if need GB Bios protection https://docs.retroachievements.org/Console-Specific-Tips/#gb-and-gbc-bios

Rejected:
replace basic slots criteria from "2 lines" to "combined payout of at least 10x your bet"?
change Practice cheevos (except Craps) to either mode?
should "Current Mission Cash Total" be included in "Cash Winnings" RP/achievements? *NO*
	-at end of mission: (same frame) "Player's Cash" zeroed out, "Player's Current Mission Cash Total" and "Player's Mission 1 Cash Winnings" set (amount duplicated!)
	-at start of next mission: "Player's Current Mission Cash Total" reset to 50K

Memory Digging TODO:
need way to reliably identify "hand/spin started/ended" that also works on the first & last hand/spin - also might need "poker 1st draw vs. 2nd draw"
find cheat used (player and oppponent)? - otherwise can watch for quantity decrease

Unused Titles:
Practice Mode "Academy"
"Goombah"
"Bootlegger Boot to Face"
"Well Done" / "Medium Rare"

Game Bugs/Unexpected Behavior
-----------------------------
* Blackjack: (not a bug - seems intended) Being dealt 8+ cards causes unique display where only 5 cards are shown, with a number representing the hidden cards point value to the left
* Blackjack: (not a bug - implementation detail) "Player's Hand Card 1-8" are not cleared out after each hand, only overwritten individually as you are dealt new cards
* Blackjack: (not a bug - seems intended) Splitting Aces doesn't allow you to "Hit" (nor use Ace/King cheats), only "Stand/Cheat" on both hands
* Craps: (bug or non-standard craps rules) some single-roll bets (Any Craps, Craps 2/3/12, Seven, Yoleven) remain in play after winning the bet (but not after losing it)
