TODO:
* Craps: need to also check if bet is "Off"? (only if not using payouts/player's cash increase)
* finish any TODOs in rascript code
* revise Poker achievements to use "Draw Number" where applicable
* more measured/trigger conditions?

Done:
* change Video Poker scoring events to both modes?
* test for false triggers on loading password + password protection
* test if need GB Bios protection https://docs.retroachievements.org/Console-Specific-Tips/#gb-and-gbc-bios
* remove 1-2 cherry/1-2 pair practice achievements, merge 2 cherry/2 pair into lowest non-practice
* Change "any gangster" challenges to be vs. specific gangster (variety pack):
	Max		use no cheats						(10)
	Sam		use all cheats						(10)
	Harry	win DP in <= 6 hands				(10) alt: 350K winnings
	Louis	win all casino games				(10) alt: 350K winnings
	Al		win with >= 12 DPP remaining		(25)
	Alt ideas: 350K winnings, win all DP hands, win X in a row BJ or DP hands, cash out in DP, cash out in BJ (very rare/luck-based), lose first three/win DP, time limit, win two jackpots
* redo scoring badges
* Leaderboard - each mission remaining DPP?
* Craps: fix "too complex" achievements
	count # of bets made at end of players turn - must be equal to X
	on AI turn, count/check winning bets

Rejected:
* replace basic slots criteria from "2 lines" to "combined payout of at least 10x your bet"?
* change Practice cheevos (except Craps) to either mode?
* should "Current Mission Cash Total" be included in "Cash Winnings" RP/achievements? (no - after investigation)
	-at end of mission: (same frame) "Player's Cash" zeroed out, "Player's Current Mission Cash Total" and "Player's Mission 1 Cash Winnings" set (amount duplicated!)
	-at start of next mission: "Player's Current Mission Cash Total" reset to 50K
* change "Academy" achievements description to "Demonstrate..."? (no - gets too long/wordy)
* Leaderboards - most cash in each casino game? craps?

Game Bugs/Unexpected Behavior
-----------------------------
* Blackjack: (not a bug - seems intended) Being dealt 8+ cards causes unique display where only 5 cards are shown, with a number representing the hidden cards point value to the left
* Blackjack: (not a bug - implementation detail) "Player's Hand Card 1-8" are not cleared out after each hand, only overwritten individually as you are dealt new cards
* Blackjack: (not a bug - seems intended) Splitting Aces doesn't allow you to "Hit" (nor use Ace/King cheats), only "Stand/Cheat" on both hands
* Craps: (bug or non-standard craps rules) some single-roll bets (Any Craps, Craps 2/3/12, Seven, Yoleven) remain in play after winning the bet (but not after losing it)
