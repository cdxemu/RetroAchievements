* Beat the game without using any continues

Per-Stage Challenges:
* Minimum Jumps - beat with only the minimum required number of jumps

* Full Clear - beat while killing all enemies and destroying all obstacles (except helicopters/missiles/windows)
* Beat each stage without any vertical movement (excluding Stage 2)


Initial Plan (Cut)
------------------
(was unable to find any memory addresses for enemy health/kills)
Enemies/Optional Stuff:
* Kill X number of each enemy type (in one game? one level?)
* Kill/destroy certain enemies/obstacles by running them over
* Shoot the sphere in Stage 1 at least 10 times (just for fun - it does nothing but only appears once in the game)
