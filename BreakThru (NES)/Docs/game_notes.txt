Misc Testing Notes
------------------
Stage Names: "Mountain", "Bridges", "Prairie", "City", "Recover the Aircraft"
Goal: rescue the stolen PK430 Aircraft 800 miles away

After game over/continue: score reset to 0, but remain at current stage/checkpoint
After ending cutscene: game continues from Stage 1

Min required jumps per stage: 3, 8?, 2, 0, 5

Stage 1 sphere: XPos (Mem 0x00b3) = 16-17, YPos (Mem 0x0006) = 7 

Demo Mode:
Stage 1 (start of stage -> shoots a few times then crashes into rock, start of stage -> shoots ammo crate and falls off cliff, start of stage -> shoots a bunch of stuff then crashes into rock)

"Unbreakable" test run - my deaths: 0, 1, 1, 2, 1

Game Bugs/Unexpected Behavior
-----------------------------
* The "Stage Transition Indicator" (Mem 0x009e) still has value 0x01 (stage completed) at start of Stage 1 if you continue playing after the game ending
(affects Stage 1 challenges - fixed by adding Mem 0x00b3 > 0 check)

* Player's last life is decremented at the Game Over screen (on the first frame) rather than in the stage
(affects "Unbreakable" challenges - fixed by adding ResetNextIf/AndNext that checks if the current stage # switched to the Game Over screen value) 

* After a game over, the demo starts playing from your last checkpoint! (but only once - in fact, the player can no longer continue their game after the demo plays once)
(this implies that most, if not all, achievements should have demo protection, rather than just early Stage 1)
